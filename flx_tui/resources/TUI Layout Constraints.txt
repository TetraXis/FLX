Layout is built using binary trees.

Docks are divided in half horizontally or vertically.

widgets (including docks) can be:

aligned to up/down/left/right and ony of these combinations			4 BITS
Size changed vertically/horizontally								2 BITS
Fill mode fill/flex (if sizing is forbidden fixed is implied)		1 BIT
Flex mode weight													2 BITS
(bc chars are so small, steps of ~25% would be plenty)
