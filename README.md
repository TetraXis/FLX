# Fast and Lightweight Experience

This is a collection of C++20 libraries, some of which re-implement features of the STL.
The idea is to create a dependency-free ecosystem of fast and lightweight tools.

Implemented libraries:

- types
- unique_ptr

Libraries in progress:

- type_traits
- linked_list
- tui

Yes, this is pointless. Yes, I'm still going to do it. Feedback is welcome.
